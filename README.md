## My thoughts on the meaning of "opensource"

We are in an age where the Middle Ages as a concept is outdated no? 
To speak of feudalism 2.0 is far-fetched but have you ever thought about how your behavior within society really matters? 
Often those you believe are providing a service to make you work “better” are just renting you a plot of virtual land to build “your” virtual vegetable garden. 
The effort you do not make today to build something “your own” or that can belong to a community is yet another baby step that third parties are taking who can dispose of your future as they wish 🙈🙉🙊 
That is what opensource is all about: healthy rebellion and sustainability.
Don't be afraid to put yourself out there, to be creative, to be free, to invent, to help, to shape something new 🧡
You should not experience contribution as a “race to the top” where everyone is racing to prove they are number one, but as an opportunity to do your part for a freer tomorrow and where you will have less back pain hoeing the garden... your garden hopefully 🌱
